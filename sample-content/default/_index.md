<!-- title: Welcome to your new website! -->
<!-- subtitle: Get Started -->

This site is generated from the content files in the /content folder. To remove this message, delete the _index.md file. To remove all the content, delete all the files! If you ever need to retrieve it, you can find it in the /sample-content folder.

The default site (using the default theme) demonstrates the following features:
* Top and Bottom menus (you can edit these in params.json)
* About and Contact pages that are only accessible in the top menu (you can set this in the header of their content files)
* Works grouped by fandom and series, sorted by date
* Fandom list at the top of the page

To change to a more minimal style, without the menus, edit params.json and change `"theme": "default",` to `"theme": "minimal",`. To modify the theme to suit your needs, check out the Theme section in README.md.

## Quick Start

1. Delete all the files in the /content folder (make a backup if you want to retain this information)
2. Add your own files in /content. You can use markdown, plain HTML, or AO3 downloaded HTML files.
3. Edit your site's title and your name in params.json.
4. Run makesite.cmd or makesite.sh, e.g. by double clicking it or by typing in a command/terminal window. If you already have a window running makesite open, type ctrl-c to stop it first.
5. Visit the website it tells you to see your new site.

More information can be found in README.md, including how to create your own theme and change the settings.
